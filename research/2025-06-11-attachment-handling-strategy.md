# Attachment Handling Strategy

*Research conducted: June 11, 2025*

## Question
How should our email briefing system handle emails with attachments? Should we ignore them, note their existence, or process them?

## Summary
‚úÖ **Recommend ignoring attachments for MVP with simple existence notification**. This is pragmatic, secure, and aligns with industry approaches for automated email processing.

## Industry Analysis

### How Email Automation Tools Handle Attachments

#### SaneBox (Advanced Attachment Processing)
**Approach**: **Sophisticated attachment management with cloud integration**
- **SaneAttachments Feature**: Automatically saves attachments to cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box)
- **Processing Thresholds**: Only processes attachments larger than 256KB (up to 9MB maximum)
- **Email Modification**: Removes large attachments from emails but adds text links to cloud storage
- **Safety Measures**: Leaves embedded attachments that could damage email structure
- **Privacy**: Explicitly states "never store full emails or attachments" on their servers

#### Boomerang (Basic Attachment Recognition)
**Approach**: **Simple attachment awareness without processing**
- **Recognition Only**: Can identify emails with attachments for search/filtering
- **No Processing**: Doesn't download, summarize, or modify attachments
- **Focus**: Primarily email scheduling and productivity, not attachment management

#### Modern AI Email Tools (2024)
**Approach**: **AI-powered attachment summarization (complex)**
- **Capability**: Can summarize PDFs, Word docs, presentations up to 25 email threads
- **Processing**: Extracts content from attachments and provides bullet point summaries
- **Limitations**: Struggles with images, charts, and visual content
- **Privacy Concerns**: Requires sending attachments to AI services (security implications)

## Attachment Handling Options Analysis

### 1. Ignore Attachments Completely ‚úÖ (Recommended for MVP)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Simply don't mention attachments in briefings
async function generateEmailSummary(email: EmailMessage): Promise<string> {
  // Focus only on email body and headers
  const summary = await claude.summarize({
    subject: email.subject,
    body: email.body,
    from: email.from,
    // Explicitly ignore attachments
  });
  
  return summary;
}
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **Simple**: No additional complexity or infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Fast**: No attachment downloading or processing delays  
- ‚úÖ **Secure**: No attachment content sent to AI services
- ‚úÖ **Cost-effective**: No storage or processing costs
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-friendly**: Attachments remain private in Gmail
- ‚úÖ **Reliable**: No attachment processing failures

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Context**: Important document context might be lost
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **User Surprise**: Users might expect attachment awareness

### 2. Note Attachment Existence (Enhanced MVP)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
async function generateEmailSummary(email: EmailMessage): Promise<string> {
  const hasAttachments = email.has_attachment; // From Himalaya envelope data
  
  const summary = await claude.summarize({
    subject: email.subject,
    body: email.body,
    from: email.from,
    attachmentNote: hasAttachments ? "üìé Contains attachments" : null
  });
  
  return hasAttachments 
    ? `${summary}\n\nüìé This email contains attachments - view in Gmail for details.`
    : summary;
}
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **User Awareness**: Users know attachments exist
- ‚úÖ **Simple**: Just a flag check, no processing
- ‚úÖ **Guidance**: Directs users to Gmail for full context

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Value**: Doesn't provide attachment details
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Still Missing Context**: AI classification lacks attachment content

### 3. Download and Process Attachments (Complex)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
async function processEmailWithAttachments(email: EmailMessage): Promise<string> {
  if (email.has_attachment) {
    // Download attachments via Himalaya
    const attachments = await downloadAttachments(email.id);
    
    // Process each attachment
    const attachmentSummaries = await Promise.all(
      attachments.map(att => processAttachment(att))
    );
    
    // Include in AI classification
    return await claude.summarize({
      subject: email.subject,
      body: email.body,
      attachments: attachmentSummaries
    });
  }
  
  return await generateEmailSummary(email);
}
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete Context**: Full email + attachment content for AI
- ‚úÖ **Rich Summaries**: Can summarize PDFs, documents, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Better Classification**: More accurate needs-response detection

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå **Complexity**: Significant implementation overhead
- ‚ùå **Performance**: Slow processing, large API costs
- ‚ùå **Storage**: Need temp storage for downloaded attachments  
- ‚ùå **Privacy**: Attachments sent to AI services
- ‚ùå **Security**: Risk of malicious attachments
- ‚ùå **Rate Limits**: Heavy API usage for large attachments
- ‚ùå **Error Handling**: Many new failure modes

## Himalaya Attachment Capabilities

### Current Support
```bash
# Check if email has attachments (from envelope data)
himalaya -c ./config.toml envelope list -o json
# Returns: "has_attachment": true/false

# Download attachments
himalaya -c ./config.toml attachment download EMAIL_ID
# Downloads to configured downloads-dir
```

### Attachment Information Available
- **Existence Flag**: `has_attachment` boolean in envelope data
- **Download Capability**: Can download all attachments to local directory
- **No Metadata**: No attachment names, sizes, or types in envelope listing

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Attachment Processing Risks
- **Malware**: Downloading unknown attachments poses security risks
- **Privacy**: Sending attachments to AI services exposes sensitive content
- **Data Residue**: Downloaded attachments need secure cleanup
- **Compliance**: Attachment processing may violate privacy policies

### Safe Approaches
- **Never Download**: Avoid security risks entirely
- **Metadata Only**: Only process attachment existence, not content
- **User Control**: Let users choose which attachments to process

## Industry Best Practices (2024)

### Attachment Summarization Challenges
- **Visual Content**: "Summarizing information contained in images poses a challenge"
- **Chart/Table Data**: AI struggles with visual data representations
- **Context Loss**: Important visual context often missing from text summaries

### Privacy-First Approaches
- **Filtering**: "Leading platforms filter out sensitive information before sending emails to AI"
- **Local Processing**: Keep sensitive attachments local when possible
- **User Consent**: Require explicit permission for attachment processing

## Recommendation

**For MVP: Ignore Attachments with Optional Existence Notification**

### Implementation Strategy

```typescript
// Phase 1: Complete ignorance (simplest)
async function generateEmailBriefing(email: EmailMessage): Promise<string> {
  // Process only email content, ignore attachments completely
  return await summarizeEmailContent({
    subject: email.subject,
    body: email.body,
    from: email.from
  });
}

// Phase 2: Attachment awareness (if user feedback requests it)
async function generateEmailBriefingWithAttachmentNote(email: EmailMessage): Promise<string> {
  const summary = await summarizeEmailContent(email);
  
  if (email.has_attachment) {
    return `${summary}\n\nüìé This email includes attachments - view in Gmail for complete context.`;
  }
  
  return summary;
}
```

### Migration Path
1. ‚úÖ **MVP**: Ignore attachments completely
2. üîÑ **Phase 2**: Add attachment existence notes if users request
3. üöÄ **Phase 3**: Consider selective attachment processing for specific file types (if needed)

### User Experience
- **Gmail Links**: Users click Gmail links in briefings to see full emails with attachments
- **Clear Expectations**: Users understand briefings are text-only summaries
- **No Surprises**: System behavior is predictable and transparent

### Benefits of This Approach
- üöÄ **Fast Implementation**: No attachment complexity for MVP
- üîí **Secure**: No attachment processing risks
- üí∞ **Cost-effective**: No additional storage or AI processing costs
- üéØ **Focused**: Concentrates on core email classification value
- üìà **Scalable**: Can add attachment processing later if needed

## Conclusion

**Ignoring attachments for MVP is the right call**. It follows industry patterns (Boomerang), avoids complexity (unlike SaneBox's sophisticated system), and maintains security/privacy. Users can always click through to Gmail for full context, which is likely their preferred workflow for attachment-heavy emails anyway.

The core value proposition - AI email classification and briefing generation - doesn't require attachment processing to be successful.
